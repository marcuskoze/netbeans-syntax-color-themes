# Netbeans syntax highlight themes
Syntax highlight themes for Netbeans that I made along the years.
## Goals
This is a constant struggle of mine to achieve a "close-to-perfect" syntax highlight theme, so that both *clean* and *messy* code are as readable as possible, while being easy enough on the eyes (I try to avoid overly bright colors such as Sublime-Text default theme that seriously affect your chromatophores :) ).

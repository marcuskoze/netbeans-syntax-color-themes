# Netbeans syntax highlight themes
Syntax highlight themes for Netbeans that I made along the years.
## Goals
This is a constant struggle of mine to achieve a "close-to-perfect" syntax highlight theme,
so that both *clean* and *messy* code are as readable as possible, while being easy enough
on the eyes (I try to avoid overly bright colors such as Sublime-Text default theme that
seriously affect your chromatophores :) ).

**Please note** that the themes look great according to may personal taste AND my monitor's color,
brightness and other such hardware settings. Your experience may vary due to these factors, I can
only hope that they're helpful.

My font is [Bitstream Vera Sans Mono](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/ttf-bitstream-vera/1.10/ ), size 12 (in Netbeans measuring system).

## Installation
1. Download the ZIP archive for the theme you'd like to install.
2. From Netbeans menu go to `Tools > Options`, then select `Fonts & Colors`. At the bottom of the options window click the `Import...` button.
3. In the popup that appears, use the `Import Source...` file selector to browse for the downloaded archive. Once loaded, the `Select Options for Import` selector below should present you with the available options (in our case, the `Fonts & Colors` with the name of the theme under it). If not already checked, do check the theme name to import the syntax highlight colors.

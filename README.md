# Netbeans syntax highlight themes
Syntax highlight themes for Netbeans that I made along the years.
## Goals
This is a constant struggle of mine to achieve an acceptable balance between clearly emphasizing code elements *and* avoiding eye fatigue over the course of a day of work.

**Please note** that the themes look good according to my personal taste and (most notably) my monitor's color,
brightness and other such hardware settings. Your experience may vary due to these factors, I can
only hope that they're helpful for some of you.

The font I use is [Bitstream Vera Sans Mono](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/ttf-bitstream-vera/1.10/ ), size 12 (in Netbeans measuring system).

## Installation
1. Download the ZIP archive for the theme you'd like to install.
2. From Netbeans menu go to `Tools > Options`, then select `Fonts & Colors`. At the bottom of the options window click the `Import...` button.
3. In the popup that appears, use the `Import Source...` file selector to browse for the downloaded archive. Once loaded, the `Select Options for Import` selector below should present the available options (in our case, the `Fonts & Colors` with the name of the theme under it). If not already checked, do check the theme name to import the syntax highlight colors.
4. Click `Ok` to finish importing the theme. Enjoy!

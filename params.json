Your experience may vary due to these factors, I can\r\nonly hope that they're helpful for some of you.\r\n\r\nThe font I use is [Bitstream Vera Sans Mono](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/ttf-bitstream-vera/1.10/ ), size 12 (in Netbeans measuring system).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n1. Download the ZIP archive for the theme you'd like to install.\r\n2. From Netbeans menu go to `Tools > Options`, then select `Fonts & Colors`. At the bottom of the options window click the `Import...` button.\r\n3. In the popup that appears, use the `Import Source...` file selector to browse for the downloaded archive. Once loaded, the `Select Options for Import` selector below should present the available options (in our case, the `Fonts & Colors` with the name of the theme under it). If not already checked, do check the theme name to import the syntax highlight colors.\r\n4. Click `Ok` to finish importing the theme. Enjoy!\r\n\r\n## Syntax highlight colors preview\r\n### PleasantBlues\r\n*PHP*\r\n![PleasantBlues theme - PHP demo](/images/PleasantBlues/php.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
